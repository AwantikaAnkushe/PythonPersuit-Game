Created a nostalgic mini "Snake Game" using Java.
I developed a mini snake game using Java, leveraging object-oriented programming principles. The game features a snake controlled by the player to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself.
I implemented graphical user interface elements for a user-friendly experience.
